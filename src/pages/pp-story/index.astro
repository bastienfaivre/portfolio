      Haaa, I see you have a special attention for the details for having found
      this page! Well, here is the short story about my profile picture.<br
      /><br />

      I made this pixel art in high school when I was bored. Then, this picture
      stayed forgotten on my hard drive for a few years. Then, when I created my
      GitHub account in 2019, I was looking for a profile picture, and I
      rediscovered this pixel art when digging through my files. I decided to
      use it. Since then, this image has been my profile picture for most of my
      accounts on the internet!<br /><br />

      I love this picture. It makes me somehow... nostalgic.
